This project compares Q-learning and Deep Q-Learning for tracking time-varying setpoints in a batch process. We evaluate these reinforcement learning methods in a non-isothermal batch reaction system. Additionally, we assess their performance against a nonlinear model predictive controller, with a future focus on optimizing the batch process. Currently working on Proximal Policy Optimization.
